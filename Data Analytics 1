Data Analytics using Python
Data Analytics 1
Python code file name: Data Analysis 1 - Students_performance_data.ipynb
  1. Analysing data using Studentsperformance csv file
     1. Importing major libraries
     2. Import data into python
     3. Checking the structure of the data
     4. Univariable and Bivariable data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, also pandas for tabulations
         1. pie diagram for Gender
         2. Bar plot for parental level of education
         3. Continuous variable analysis
             1. to find the minimum math score
             2. to find the maximum reading score
             3. to find the average writing score
             4. histogram to show the skewness of data
     5. Bivariable analysis
     6. correlation analysis
     7. crosstabulation
     8. Mulitiple bar diagrams
     9. stacked bar
     10. visualization using seaborn, sns package 
     11. visualization using matplotlib, plt package
  
  Python code file (feature engineering ): DA1 Feature engineering.ipynb
 
 1. import libraries
 2. import data
 3. creating new variables(feature engineering) using the condition
 4. computing the total score for each student
 5. computing percentage for each of the students
 6. finidng the status of students by,
    1. if a student fails on 3 paper then he/ she fails in that semester
    2. otherwise everyone pass
 7. Assigning grades to the percentage
 8. plotting a pie chart for the distribution of various grades amongst the students
 9. comparison parent's degree and their corresponding grades
 10. comparing the distribution of grades among males and female
 11. transforming all categorical variables to numerical by using label encoding
 12. if we encode the data, we can move for many different types of analysis
